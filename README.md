replacement for a real "lava lamp" with a WS2812 LED matrix

For my wife, I just completed a project to replace a real lava lamp with s.th. less dangerous and dirty (just consider the mess if a real lava lamp falls to the ground and breaks...). After some experiments, I decided to realize that project with an [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) microcontroler driving a 16x16 matrix of WS2812 LEDs.
